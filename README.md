Summary:


There is little statistical difference when comparing the weather data from June and December.  Even in December, the average temperature is 71 degrees and reaching a high of 83 degrees. While we might not be surprised by these findings, there is one area of note.  The low temperature in December is 56 degrees as compared to a low of 64 degrees in June.

A detailed query to find the temperature by hour, in December, may be useful for considering an adjustment to business hours during this month. Also, a query to find severe weather activity for the two months may be helpful in being proactive about planning business activities.
