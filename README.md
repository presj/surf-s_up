•	When we compare the two months, we can see there is a difference of approximately 4 degrees in average temperature.  
	June’s average temperature is 75 degrees and December’s average temperature is 71 degrees.  
•	When we compare the two months based on the high temperature, again, there is little difference.  The difference is 2 degrees.
•	The greatest temperature variance is seen in the low temperature comparison. In June the low is 64 degrees while in December the low is 56 degrees.


Summary:


There is little statistical difference when comparing the weather data from June and December.  Even in December, the average temperature is 71 degrees and reaching a high of 83 degrees. While we might not be surprised by these findings, there is one area of note.  The low temperature in December is 56 degrees as compared to a low of 64 degrees in June. 

Given this difference two additional queries are recommended to finalize the analysis for this business venture. A detailed query to find the temperature by hour, in December, may be useful for considering an adjustment to business hours during this month. Also, a query to find severe weather activity for the two months may be helpful in being proactive about planning business activities.
